  !https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-shadow
  * So now we want add shadow to chair cart  
  * to add shadow we use box-shadow property and this is how we add shadow to box
  * box-shadow property requires multiple properties we can specify  4 or 5 values
  = the first one:  the horizontal offset of the shadow we specify a length which will then be the horizontal offset between box and shadow
  = the second value: the vertical  direction so basically the offset of the shadow from the box in this direction here 
  = the third value is the blur(do mo) of the shadow, if this values is small the shadow have small blur but if bigger then shadow will be blur big
  = the fourth value: is optional allow us to basically scale the shadow up, default it's 0
  = the last one: is color of the shadow
  * when we use color for shadow we need use with opacity and to dot hat we usually use the rgba() for that, rgba(0,0,0, 0.1)
  ! the opacity is bellow 0.1(max) for shadow we can also specify it's greater like 0.3, 0.6 but it's too dark for shadow and it's unnatural
  * usually in interface design we want the light source to basically come from the top if we specify the first value 20px the light source look like from top across and its not we want therefore the first value usually we set it 0
  * because for these cards we use medium shadow so the vertically offset of the second value is 20 px it's logic
  * So if we specify the third value now we can see obviously the shadow box because it’s not blur(mo) right
  *You can see the box shadow is bigger the current card right that’s cuz we set the fourth option which scale the box-shadow to 10px now it’s bigger than current box 10px and usually we did it with 0 */
